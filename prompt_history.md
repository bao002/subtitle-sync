### Prompt 1: Initial App Import
```
This app was imported from GitHub repository mostuf2556/subtitle-sync.
```

---

### Prompt 2: Punctuation Paired Wrapping & TTS In-Between Order
```
1. by default split by punctuations (in case of ".",
,","?", "!" (but wrap together text within start/closing couples of punctuation chars  such as: "\"\" or "("  )
2. should the video be played before or after the tts-play? add another option which is to play the video in between tts-play groups (1 group to play before , one group to play after the video-play)
Apply style changes to the selected element(s).

### Prompt 4: Supabase Quarantine, TTS-Ratio Fix, Alternative TTS Services, Place Video in Language Order & Mobile Responsiveness
```
0. AGENTS.md - quarentine any superbase related files and docs (no prompt instruction have been issued regarding db support on this project!). always keep historic prompts to prompt_history.md
1. advance mode - tts-ratio sometimes work, sometimes the tts-play stops without any reported reason
2. currently not working: 
- using google tts service directly (it worked before)
- using https://tts3.lovable.app/api/public/openapi.json
3. there is no in-between order for tts-play. tts-play before-video is not working
4. by design it should be easier to set the place of the video within the order of the languages in order to detemine when to play the video
5. on mobile view - page size should be responsive and adapt to fit the screen size
```

---

### Prompt 5: Validation for Remote TTS Services (Google TTS Directly or TTS3 Service)
```
add validation to tts-remove-service: google-tts-directly or tts3 service
```

---

### Prompt 6: Quarantine Beginner Mode, Debug Mode Menu Toggle, and Language Selection Columns (is-primary and json3)
```
1. go on
2. currently quarentine beginner mode 
3. ensure toggle on top menu to switch to debug mode where experimental views are also presented (such as playground)
4. language selection view:
- add column "is-primary" - the only way to define the tts-ration absolute parent
- add column "json3" which should be updated based upon user's manual toggling of that language on the video player (another indication of direct fetching).
```
